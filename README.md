# MEDCoupling

[![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/medcoupling.svg?style=flat-square)](https://pypi.org/project/medcoupling)

This repository provides a Python repackaging of the latest version (9.7.0) of the [MEDCoupling](https://docs.salome-platform.org/latest/dev/MEDCoupling/developer/index.html) library via a Python file `setup.py` and hence installable via `pip`.

The initial purpose of this redistribution is to mainly use the remapping algorithms of MEDCoupling (see [pymapping](https://github.com/tianyikillua/pymapping) and [paraview-mapping](https://github.com/tianyikillua/paraview-mapping)). Hence the following MEDCoupling functionalities are NOT supported

- MED file reading/writing via `MEDLoader`, so the `MED-file` library is not required (`MEDCOUPLING_MICROMED=ON`)
- Parallel functionalities (`MEDCOUPLING_ENABLE_PARTITIONER=OFF`)
- Renumbering (`MEDCOUPLING_ENABLE_RENUMBER=OFF`), which depends on `boost`

## Versioning

The version of this package (on PyPI) follows that of MEDCoupling. For MEDCoupling 9.7.0 for instance, we use

```
v9.7.0r1, v9.7.0r2, ...
```

to designate all PyPI releases based on MEDCoupling 9.7.0. The suffix `r[x]` is included (abusively, since according to PEP 440 it is for post releases) for possible bug fixes coming from this package.

## Installation from PyPI

To install MEDCoupling, you can now simply do

```
pip install -U medcoupling
```

Binary wheels are available for 64-bit Windows (`win_amd64`), Linux-like platforms (`manylinux2014_x86_64`) and macOS (`macosx_10_11_x86_64`).

To assure that MEDCoupling is well installed, try importing it in your Python

```
import medcoupling  # should not raise error
```

## Building from source

Running `python setup.py install` or `pip install .` will

1. Download the source code of MEDCoupling from [salome-platform.org](http://files.salome-platform.org/Salome/other/medCoupling-9.7.0.tar.gz)
2. Build the C++ / Python libraries using `cmake` and `swig`
3. Distribute and install generated files using `setuptools`

The building process has been tested under Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2019, under Ubuntu 18.04 with gcc 7.4, under the [manylinux2014](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux) platform and under macOS 10.15.

## Uploading to PyPI
